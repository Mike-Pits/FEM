This repo is an attempt to use NNs approach in FEM calculations.
Must admit I am not a mechanical engineer and most of my actions were on a pure intuition basis.
I also deeply grateful to my younger son Fedor who consulted me and accompanied through this short but exciting journey.

I canibalized Faraz's data set (https://github.com/farazarbabi/CNN_FEM/blob/master/README.md) and hope he is ok with that.

Interestingly had to drop typical randonm train/test split approach and it did not work for FEM due to data consistency was disrupted.
Also applied a couple of slightly more elaborated models architectures.
Unfortunately could not quickly solve triangulation issues for smoother vizualization. May be it is for my later experiments.

Otherwise the results of my FEM debut could be vizually assessed at the bottoms of the block-notes.

Constructive critique, remarks and questions are welcome.
