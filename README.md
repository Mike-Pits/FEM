This repo is an attempt to use NNs approach in FEM calculations.
Must admit I am not a mechanical engineer and most of my actions were on a pure intuition basis.

I am deeply grateful to my younger son Fedor who consulted me and accompanied through this short but exciting journey.
Fedor is currently majoring in mechanical engineering at the Sejong University. 

In the course of this micro-research had to canibalize Faraz's data set (https://github.com/farazarbabi/CNN_FEM/blob/master/README.md).
Hope he is ok with that :)

Interestingly could not apply typical randonm train/test split approach as it did not work for FEM due to data consistency was thus disrupted.
Also applied a couple of slightly more elaborated models architectures.
Unfortunately could not quickly solve triangulation issues for smoother vizualization of the central hole circle. 
May be for my later experiments.

Otherwise the results of my FEM debut could be vizually assessed at the bottoms of each notebook.

Constructive critique, remarks and questions are welcome.
